Each party shall (i) give access to such Confidential Information solely to those employees and consultants with a need to have access thereto for purposes of this Agreement, and (ii) take the same security precautions to protect against disclosure or unauthorized use of such Confidential Information that the party takes with its own confidential information, but, in no event, shall a party apply less than a reasonable standard of care to prevent such disclosure or unauthorized use. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either party from disclosing the Confidential Information of the other party pursuant to any judicial or governmental order or as required by law, provided that the party (to the extent allowed by law) gives the other party reasonable prior notice of such disclosure to contest such order. "<u>Confidential Information</u>" shall mean confidential or other proprietary information that is disclosed by one party to the other party under this Agreement, including, without limitation, designs, software designs and code, product specifications and documentation, business and product plans, and other confidential business information.

                <strong>Disclosure of the Existence of this Agreement.</strong> The parties each have the right to disclose the existence of this Agreement, but not the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless such disclosure is approved in writing by both parties prior to such disclosure, or is included in a filing required to be made with a governmental authority
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Use of Certain Information.</strong> Customer consents to Skycision engaging in data mining/benchmarking activities in connection with Customer\'s use of the Services and Skycision\'s use and commercialization of aggregated and de-identified Customer Data that it discloses to Skycision in connection with this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Section 4.1 of this Agreement and the satisfaction of each of the following conditions: (i) no Customer specific or Customer-identifiable information shall be disclosed, and (ii) the identity of the Customer shall be protected and shall not be disclosed.

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Infringement Claims.</strong> Subject to the remainder of this Section 5.2, in connection with the licenses granted hereunder in Section 1.2, Skycision, at its sole expense, agrees to defend Customer against any third party claim that Customer\'s use of the Services, as delivered by Skycision to Customer and used in accordance with this Agreement and the Documentation, directly infringes a third party copyright or issued patent or directly misappropriated a trade secret (but only to the extent such misappropriation is not a result of Customer\'s actions under the laws of the United States) (an "<u>Infringement
            'Claim</u>") and indemnify Customer from the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against Customer to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in settlement; provided that (i) Customer promptly notifies Skycision in writing of the Infringement Claim; (ii) Skycision has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations; and (iii) Customer provides Skycision with the information, assistance and authority to enable Skycision to perform Skycision\'s obligations under this Section 5.2. Customer may not settle or compromise any Infringement Claim without the prior written consent of Skycision. In any action based on an Infringement Claim, Skycision, at its option and its own expense, will either: (1) procure the right for Customer to continue using the Services in accordance with this Agreement; (2) make such alterations, modifications or adjustments to the Services so that the alleged infringing Services become non-infringing without incurring a material diminution in performance or function; (3) replace the Services with a non-infringing substantially similar substitute; or (4) terminate the Services license, and upon Customer certified destruction or deletion of the Services, Skycision shall refund to Customer the unused remainder of any Fees prepaid by Customer and received by Skycision. Skycision shall have no liability or obligations for an Infringement Claim pursuant to this Section 5.2 to the extent that it results from: (a) modifications to the Services made by a party other than Skycision or under the direct control of Skycision; (b) the combination, operation or use of the Services with non-Skycision products; (c) use of the Services outside of the scope of this Agreement or in contravention of the Documentation; (d) Skycision\'s use of any designs, plans, instructions, specifications, diagrams or the like, provided by Customer, if any; (e) Customer\'s failure to use all upgrades and updates to the Services provided by Skycision, if the claim would not have occurred but for such failure; (f) use of open source technology or freeware technology or any derivatives or other adaptions thereof not embedded by Skycision into the Services; or (g) any Services that are provided on a no charge, beta or evaluation basis. Nothing in this provision shall be construed as a limitation on Customer\'s ability to retain legal counsel at its own expense to passively monitor the proceedings. This Section 5.2 sets forth Customer\'s sole and exclusive remedies and Skycision\'s entire liability with respect to Infringement Claims.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Apple.</strong> In addition to terms and conditions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, Apple, Inc. ("Apple") also requires that this Agreement between Skycision and Customer include the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Acknowledgement.</i> Skycision and Customer each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement is concluded between Skycision and Customer, and not with Apple. Skycision, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Application licensed hereunder and the content thereof.

            <i>Warranty.</i> Skycision shall be solely responsible for any product warranties not effectively disclaimed hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, and without limiting the disclaimers and limitations set forth in Sections 7 and 8 below, in the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any such applicable warranty, Customer may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Application to Customer. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Application, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be Skycision's sole responsibility.

        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Intellectual Property Rights.</i> In the event of any third party claim that the Application or Customer's possession and use of that licensed Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Skycision and Apple, it is Skycision, not Apple, who will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim arising under this Agreement or applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Legal Compliance.</i> Customer hereby represents and warrants that (i) Customer is not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) Customer is not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

        <p>
            <i>Third Party Terms of Agreement.</i> Customer must comply with applicable third party terms of agreement when using the Application.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Third Party Beneficiary.</i> Customer and Skycision each acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and, upon Customer's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against Customer as a third party beneficiary to this Agreement.
        </p>

            <strong>PAYMENT.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fees.</strong> Payment of all undisputed fees and expenses pursuant to Skycision's invoices (the "<u>Fees</u>") will be due and payable prior to the commencement of each Term. Customer will pay all undisputed amounts due under Skycision’s invoices in U.S. currency, free of any and all currency controls or other restrictions. If the Agreement is terminated by Customer as a result of Skycision's breach, Customer shall receive a prorata refund of prepaid Fees for the unused, posttermination portion of the then-current Term. Skycision does not store or maintain Customer's credit card information but instead contracts with a third party payment processor to collect and process Customer's payment information.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Late Payments.</strong> If the Customer fails to pay an invoice in a timely manner, all such invoices will bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is less. Skycision shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses incurred in collecting any amounts due hereunder, including reasonable attorneys' fees. In addition to any other remedy available, Skycision may restrict or suspend Customer's access to the Services if payment is not made when due.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Taxes.</strong> Fees under this Agreement are exclusive of all taxes, including national, state or provincial and local use, sales, property and similar taxes, if any.

        </p>
        <p><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY.</strong></p>
        <p>
            Protection of Confidential Information. Each party agrees not to transfer or otherwise disclose the Confidential Information of the other party to any third party except as allowed by this Agreement. Each party shall (i) give access to such Confidential Information solely to those employees and consultants with a need to have access thereto for purposes of this Agreement, and (ii) take the same security precautions to protect against disclosure or unauthorized use of such Confidential Information that the party takes with its own confidential information, but, in no event, shall a party apply less than a reasonable standard of care to prevent such disclosure or unauthorized use. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either party from disclosing the Confidential Information of the other party pursuant to any judicial or governmental order or as required by law, provided that the party (to the extent allowed by law) gives the other party reasonable prior notice of such disclosure to contest such order. "<u>Confidential Information</u>" shall mean confidential or other proprietary information that is disclosed by one party to the other party under this Agreement, including, without limitation, designs, software designs and code, product specifications and documentation, business and product plans, and other confidential business information.

        <p>
            <strong>Disclosure of the Existence of this Agreement.</strong> The parties each have the right to disclose the existence of this Agreement, but not the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless such disclosure is approved in writing by both parties prior to such disclosure, or is included in a filing required to be made with a governmental authority
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Use of Certain Information.</strong> Customer consents to Skycision engaging in data mining/benchmarking activities in connection with Customer's use of the Services and Skycision's use and commercialization of aggregated and de-identified Customer Data that it discloses to Skycision in connection with this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Section 4.1 of this Agreement and the satisfaction of each of the following conditions: (i) no Customer specific or Customer-identifiable information shall be disclosed, and (ii) the identity of the Customer shall be protected and shall not be disclosed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Intellectual Property Rights.</strong> Except as expressly set forth herein, Skycision shall retain all right, title and interest in, and shall be the sole owner of, the Services, Documentation, and Skycision's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) therein.

            Property Rights</u>" shall mean all forms of intellectual property rights and protections, including without limitation, all right, title and interest arising under United States common and statutory law and the laws of other countries to all: (i) patents and all filed, pending or potential applications for patents, including any reissue, reexamination, division, continuation or continuation-in-part applications throughout the world now or hereafter filed; (ii) trade secret rights and equivalent rights; (iii) copyrights, other literary property or authors rights, whether or not protected by copyright or as a mask work; and (iv) proprietary indicia, trademarks, trade names, symbols, logos and/or brand names.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Infringement Claims.</strong> Subject to the remainder of this Section 5.2, in connection with the licenses granted hereunder in Section 1.2, Skycision, at its sole expense, agrees to defend Customer against any third party claim that Customer's use of the Services, as delivered by Skycision to Customer and used in accordance with this Agreement and the Documentation, directly infringes a third party copyright or issued patent or directly misappropriated a trade secret (but only to the extent such misappropriation is not a result of Customer's actions under the laws of the United States) (an "<u>Infringement
            Claim</u>") and indemnify Customer from the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against Customer to such third party by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in settlement; provided that (i) Customer promptly notifies Skycision in writing of the Infringement Claim; (ii) Skycision has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations; and (iii) Customer provides Skycision with the information, assistance and authority to enable Skycision to perform Skycision's obligations under this Section 5.2. Customer may not settle or compromise any Infringement Claim without the prior written consent of Skycision. In any action based on an Infringement Claim, Skycision, at its option and its own expense, will either: (1) procure the right for Customer to continue using the Services in accordance with this Agreement; (2) make such alterations, modifications or adjustments to the Services so that the alleged infringing Services become non-infringing without incurring a material diminution in performance or function; (3) replace the Services with a non-infringing substantially similar substitute; or (4) terminate the Services license, and upon Customer certified destruction or deletion of the Services, Skycision shall refund to Customer the unused remainder of any Fees prepaid by Customer and received by Skycision. Skycision shall have no liability or obligations for an Infringement Claim pursuant to this Section 5.2 to the extent that it results from: (a) modifications to the Services made by a party other than Skycision or under the direct control of Skycision; (b) the combination, operation or use of the Services with non-Skycision products; (c) use of the Services outside of the scope of this Agreement or in contravention of the Documentation; (d) Skycision's use of any designs, plans, instructions, specifications, diagrams or the like, provided by Customer, if any; (e) Customer's failure to use all upgrades and updates to the Services provided by Skycision, if the claim would not have occurred but for such failure; (f) use of open source technology or freeware technology or any derivatives or other adaptions thereof not embedded by Skycision into the Services; or (g) any Services that are provided on a no charge, beta or evaluation basis. Nothing in this provision shall be construed as a limitation on Customer's ability to retain legal counsel at its own expense to passively monitor the proceedings. This Section 5.2 sets forth Customer's sole and exclusive remedies and Skycision's entire liability with respect to Infringement Claims.
